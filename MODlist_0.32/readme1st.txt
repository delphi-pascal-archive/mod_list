You don't need Project1.* files. They are from original delphi vcl project. Use
them if you want to migrate MODlist to standart Delphi vcl.

To compile MODlist you need:
1. KOL & MCK components: http://www.kolnmck.ru/files1.shtml
2. GRush Controls: http://www.kolnmck.ru/components/files_controls.shtml
3. Audio Tools Library: http://www.kolnmck.ru/components/files_media.shtml
4. MCKGif (included)

MODlist was written in Delphi 7.
