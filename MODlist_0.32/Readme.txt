     ====:: Introduction ::===================================================
MODlist - is a program to create list of tracker modules, MIDI, and stream 
audio files(like MP3, etc) in chosen folder. List includes: filename, title, 
length, file size. List is formatted according to template, so list's file 
format can be any format, that can be edited as text(html, csv, etc).
MODlist is freeware program providing under terms of GNU General Public Licence

     ====:: Supported File Types ::===========================================
Tracker modules, MIDI, etc:
XM, MOD, S3M, IT, MO3, MTM, UMX, 669, MID, V2M, OXM, RMI, STC, ASC, STP, PSC 
FLS, FTC, PT1, PT2, PT3, SQT, GTR, FXM, PSM, VTX, PSG, YM, OUT, ZXAY, AY, AYM
Stream audio files:
MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF, WMA, MPC, AAC, VQF, APE, FLAC, WVC, WV, TTA, 
OFR, M4A, AC3

     ====:: Usage ::==========================================================
In editbox "Folder" enter path or browse for a folder containing tracker
modules to list with "Browse..." button. Editbox "File header" contains text
that will be added at the beginning of list file. Editboxes "Row start",
"Between rows", "Row end" contains rows formatting text. The same is for
"Columns formatting" group of editboxes. Type letters corresponded to column 
in "Include columns" EditBox(see tip in program's window), order of this 
letters changes order of columns(Artist column is not supported for some file
types). "File footer" contains text that will be added at the end of list. 
"Include file types" editbox contains list of file extension to index. 
Extension must start with dot "." symbol and end with ";"(without quotes). 
Press one of three buttons below to quickly choose only trackers, stream, or 
all file types. "Include non-audio & too large files" will include files that 
are not really contain audio data and files that are larger then specified 
size. Set other options as you wish. "Convert title strings to HTML format" 
options is useful for html list format, it will change symbols that browser 
can't show into html format, so they'll be shown fine in browser. "Add HTML 
links to columns" option makes HTML links(<a href=) from text in specified 
columns (use letters like in "Include columns" editbox), links can begin with 
some prefix like website address. "Make list" button opens file save dialog for
 list file. You can use already made templates by pressing "Load template" 
button and choosing template file. You can save template by pressing "Save 
template" button. "Clear all" button clears all template text in editboxes.

quotes), where "format" is date and time formatting string that can contain
